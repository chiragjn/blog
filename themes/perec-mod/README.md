# Perec-Mod

Perec-Mod is an evolving modification of the [Perec](https://github.com/ggimse/perec) which is an evolving modification of the [pelican-svbhack](https://github.com/giulivo/pelican-svbhack) theme for [Pelican](http://getpelican.com) with influences from [uno](https://github.com/daleanthony/uno) which was written for [Ghost](http://www.ghost.org). 

It  is still rather rough in some areas.

This is not production ready.
