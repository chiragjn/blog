Hello, I am **Chirag** and welcome to my blog! Although I rarely write, I consider this blog as a virtual space to park / dump my thoughts on Software and Life. Some of my interests include large scale distributed systems, natural language processing, competitive programming, compiler infrastructure and tooling. When I am not working you'll most likely find me hacking away at some open source project or diving into software abstractions or binging TV shows.

I am currently working at `Haptik`_ as a Machine Learning Engineer building NLU backend for virtual assistants. In the past I built some apps for Android, iOS and the web both professionally and in hack-a-thons. You can find more about me with the social links on the left sidebar. I keep my Linkedin fairly up to date. My internet alias on most sites is "**chiragjn**".
